    "# Understanding Context Quarantine: A Practical Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains **Context Quarantine** - a critical pattern for building effective multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Based on Two Key Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[How to Fix Your Context - Context Quarantine](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html#context-quarantine)** by Drew Breunig\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Context Quarantine?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Context Quarantine is the act of isolating contexts in their own dedicated threads, each used separately by one or more LLMs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Context Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "When contexts grow too long or contain too much information, several failures occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Confusion**: Superfluous information causes low-quality responses\n",
    "2. **Context Distraction**: Model over-focuses on context, neglecting training knowledge\n",
    "3. **Context Poisoning**: Errors propagate through shared context\n",
    "4. **Context Clash**: Conflicting information in the same context\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Quarantine\n",
    "\n",
    "Break tasks into smaller, isolated jobs - each with their own context.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> \"Subagents facilitate compression by operating in parallel with their own context windows, exploring different aspects of the question simultaneously before condensing the most important tokens for the lead research agent. Each subagent also provides **separation of concerns**—distinct tools, prompts, and exploration trajectories—which reduces path dependency and enables thorough, independent investigations.\""

    "## Part 8: Practical Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Strands for Context Quarantine\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands makes context quarantine easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Each Agent instance maintains its own conversation history\n",
    "agent1 = Agent(system_prompt=\"Specialist 1\")  # Isolated context\n",
    "agent2 = Agent(system_prompt=\"Specialist 2\")  # Isolated context\n",
    "agent3 = Agent(system_prompt=\"Specialist 3\")  # Isolated context\n",
    "\n",
    "# No shared state - automatic quarantine!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Template\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Decompose query into independent aspects\n",
    "aspects = [\"aspect1\", \"aspect2\", \"aspect3\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create specialized agents (quarantined)\n",
    "agents = [Agent(system_prompt=f\"Specialist in {a}\") for a in aspects]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Execute in parallel\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n",
    "    results = list(executor.map(lambda a: a(query), agents))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Synthesize with lead agent\n",
    "lead_agent = Agent(system_prompt=\"Synthesizer\")\n",

    "## Summary: Context Quarantine in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Give each agent its own clean room to work in.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Context Confusion** - Each agent has focused, relevant context\n",
    "2. **No Context Distraction** - Agents don't get overwhelmed\n",
    "3. **No Context Poisoning** - Errors don't propagate\n",
    "4. **Parallel Processing** - 5-10x faster execution\n",
    "5. **Better Quality** - 90%+ improvement (Anthropic)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Complex research with multiple independent directions  \n",
    "✅ Breadth-first queries  \n",
    "✅ High-value tasks (justifies 15x token cost)  \n",
    "✅ Information exceeding single context window  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation with Strands\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands makes it simple:\n",
    "- Each `Agent()` instance = isolated context\n",
    "- No manual context management\n",
    "- Automatic conversation history\n",
    "- Perfect for context quarantine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "From Anthropic's research:\n",
    "- **90.2% improvement** over single-agent\n",
    "- **5-10x faster** with parallelization\n",
    "- **Production-ready** (used in AWS Transform)\n",
